<h2>Keyboard and Mouse events</h2>
<p>
    MineDroid keyboard and mouse event system was written from HTML5 event system. Every event propagates downwards in
    views tree until it will reach the targeted element and, after it, it starts to bubble to the top of the elements
    hierarchy. Event can be cancelled at any time â€” it will prevent calling any event handler that are higher on view
    hierarchy or had been registered later than current event handler.
</p>

<h2>Subscribing/unsubscribing to an event</h2>
<p>
    To subscribe on keyboard events, you should create an instance of desired event listener interface and pass it to
    the <b>on(Event)</b> method of the view. <i>You should save your event listener on a field of your class</i> because
    EventBase uses WeakReference to store your listener. That means your event listener will be unsubscribed and
    destroyed as soon as the last reference outside of the EventBase (View) class will be removed. If you want to
    unsubscribe your event listener earlier, you can pass it to the <b>off(Event)</b> method of the View.
</p>

<h2>Other events</h2>
<p>
    Class EventBase is a simplified version of OnKiUp android library EventHub class. It allows you to send and receive
    any events derived from Event class. To use EventBase on your class, you should extend EventBase class.
