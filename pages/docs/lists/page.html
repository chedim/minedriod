<h1>Lists</h1>

<p>
    Work with ListView in MineDroid is a slightly different task than working with it in Android. Unlike Android's
    ListView, MineDroid's realization doesn't require you to create Adapters — it accepts any Lists of data. However, it
    uses ViewHolders to create, fill and control views. Every ViewHolder takes responsibility for displaying Views for
    different list item classes so, every ViewHolder should be registered in ListView with it's class by <b>setHolder(Holder)</b>
    method. ListView ViewHolders have some additional information so they should be derived from ListView.Holder
    class.
</p>
<p>
    <i>If ListView will meet any item with class that cannot be processed by any of registered ViewHolders, ListView will omit
        the item and it will not be shown.</i>
</p>

<h1>Creating ViewHolder</h1>
<p>
    To create a ViewHolder for ListView, you should extend ListView.Holder class and implement some importants methods:
<ul>
    <li><b>ResourceLocation getViewLocation</b> — returns location of views XML layout file (if you want to create your
        view in code, you can override <b>View getView()</b> method of the Holder class);
    </li>
    <li><b>void link(View)</b> — here you should accept a new view with which your holder will be associated;</li>
    <li><b>void fill(Object)</b> — here you should accept a new object with which your holder will be associated and
        populate your view with values from this object;
    </li>
</ul>
