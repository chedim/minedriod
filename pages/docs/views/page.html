<title>MineDroid Views Reference</title>
<h1>Views</h1>
<p>
    View is a basic MineDroid gui class. Views allow you to interact with player and handle mouse and/or key events and
    represent different states of your mod. You can check out View class javadoc
    <a href="javadoc/com/onkiup/minedroid/gui/views/View.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>View Measuring</h2>
<p>
    When one of the view's layout width or height parameters are set to <b>wrap_content</b>, parent view should call
    <b>Layout measure(Point)</b> method of the view. This method accepts maximum available for view width and height (as
    a Point)
    and returns measured layout with width and/or height set to values that view desires to have. These values later
    will be used by parent view to calculate resolved layout of the view which will be passed to the view via
    <b>void resolveLayout(Layout)</b> method.
</p>

<h2>Drawing view contents</h2>
<p>
    When parent draws view, it calls it's <b>onDraw</b> method which setups draw area limits for view and calls <b>drawContents</b>
    method of the view.<br/>
    When drawing your view, be sure that you use <b>position</b> property for a right placement of the view.
</p>

<h2>Keyboard and Mouse events</h2>
<p>
    MineDroid keyboard and mouse event system was written from HTML5 event system. Every event propagates downwards in
    views tree until it will reach the targeted element and, after it, it starts to bubble to the top of the elements
    hierarchy. Event can be cancelled at any time — it will prevent calling any event handler that are higher on view
    hierarchy or had been registered later than current event handler.
</p>

<h2>Subscribing/unsubscribing to an event</h2>
<p>
    To subscribe on keyboard events, you should create an instance of desired event listener interface and pass it to
    the <b>on(Event)</b> method of the view. <i>You should save your event listener on a field of your class</i> because
    EventBase uses WeakReference to store your listener. That means your event listener will be unsubscribed and
    destroyed as soon as the last reference outside of the EventBase (View) class will be removed. If you want to
    unsubscribe your event listener earlier, you can pass it to the <b>off(Event)</b> method of the View.
</p>

<h2>Keyboard and Mouse event interfaces</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>OnKeyDown</b></li>
    <li><b>OnKeyUp</b></li>
    <li><b>OnKeyPress</b></li>
    <li><b>OnMouseIn</b></li>
    <li><b>OnMouseMove</b></li>
    <li><b>OnClick</b></li>
    <li><b>OnDblClick</b></li>
    <li><b>OnMouseDown</b></li>
    <li><b>OnMouseUp</b></li>
    <li><b>OnMouseOut</b></li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Other events</h2>
<p>
    Class EventBase is a simplified version of OnKiUp android library EventHub class. It allows you to send and receive
    any events derived from Event class. To use EventBase on your class, you should extend EventBase class.
</p>

<h1>Overlays</h1>
<p>
    Overlay is a window (or, in Android — Activity) that can be shown on users screen.
    To create overlay, you should extend class com.onkiup.minecraft.gui.Overlay and register it with
    MineDroid.addScreen();
</p>

<h2>Overlay methods</h2>
<p>
<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <td>Callback method</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>void dismiss()</td>
        <td>Dismisses opened overlay</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
To create overlay, MineDroid will call it's methods <b>ResourceLocation getContentLayout()</b>. <br/>
When overlay is being shown, MineDroid will call it's method <b>onStart</b> and
<b>onStop</b> — when it is being dismissed.
