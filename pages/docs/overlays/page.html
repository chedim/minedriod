<h1>Overlays</h1>
<p>
    Overlay is a window (or, in Android — Activity) that can be shown on users screen.
    To create overlay, you should extend class com.onkiup.minecraft.gui.Overlay and register it with
    MineDroid.addScreen();
</p>

<h2>Overlay lifecycle</h2>
<p>
    To create overlay, MineDroid will call it's methods <b>View getContent()</b> and <b>Drawable getBackgroundDrawable()</b>. <br/>
    When overlay is being shown, MineDroid will call it's method <b>onStart</b> and <b>onStop</b> — when it is being dismissed.
